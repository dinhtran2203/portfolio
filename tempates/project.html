                                <h3> Problem Statement </h3>
                                <p> This contain two challenge: </p> 
                                <h4> Challenge 1: </h4>
                                <p> Have the robot start in the area that is encompassed by the track line, see figure 1. No matter where the robot is placed, it should be able to find and stop on a black circle that is 4 inches in diameter. The robot cannot leave the area within the track. Completion of this challenge is tested by starting the robot randomly in the area. </p>
                                <h4> Challenge 2: </h4>
                                <p> The robot must make two laps around the track and record the total time it takes to complete these two laps. The first lap should be completed going clockwise, and the second lap should be completed going counterclockwise. The laps start and finish on a horizontal black line on the track. The robot should start just behind the line, start a timer once the line is first passed, turn around and go the opposite direction once first lap is completed, and stop and print out the time once the second lap is completed.
                                </p>

                                <h3> Solution </h3> 
                                <p> We implemeted backwards functionality through digital logic circuit. With those we design and use QTRX class (This class was used as an interface between the programs and the raw sensor data, which ranged from 0-2000). Depending on the readings the QTRX class could detect if the sensors were over a line. The class could also return a ratio which represented how even the sensor readings were: if the ratio was negative the right sensors are reading more white values then the left sensors.</p>
                                <h3> Challenge/Diffculties </h3>
                                <p> C++ was an incredibly effective tool for accurate line readings and fast speed/direction adjustments. However, the design solutions will require a lot more fine tuning in C++ to be fully optimized. In challenge one turn ratios can be adjusted to allow the robot to more effectively traverse the inside of the track. In challenge two PID control can be implemented to provide faster traversal of the two laps while still allowing the robot to run smoothly. </p>
                                <h3> Solution Performance </h3>
                                <p>
                                    In challenge one the main issue was inaccurate sensor readings. Even when the code was performing as expected, once in every forty or so turns it would read a darker value when over white space, causing it to believe it had found the circle. The challenge is that only one sensor is used at one point to check if the circle is found. However, the sensor is accurate enough that the vast majority of the time the program will run without fail. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Originally the robot would turn randomly after running into a line. Sometimes this caused the robot to get stuck on one side of the area. The largest improvement in design was having the robot to turn away from any black lines it came into contact with. This implementation gets the robot to traverse most of the area. However, turning ratios can still be improved. If the robot turns less, it will more quickly traverse around the area. However, if it does not turn enough it will not cover a large portion of the center section. At the same time if the robot turns to much it will bounce back and forth on one side of the area.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Overall the robot completes this challenge. However, team Magic has not found an efficient turning ratio that will minimize the time needed to traverse the entire area within the track. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Challenge two had the same issue as challenge one. While the code completes the challenge, it is not optimized for speed. The QTRX class allows for fairly straight forward speed control. The ratio of line sensor readings is returned every 200ms. The PWM output is 200/1000 added or subtracted by the ratio value. Ratio is added to the PWM of the right motor and subtracted to the PWM output of the left motor. The robot will complete all tasks described in challenge 2. However, to complete the laps without wobbling it takes 81 seconds.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When the speed is increased the robot will jolt back and forth as it moves along the track. If wobbling while turning the robot will swing off of the line and loose the track completely. As a result the code prioritizes a stable run. While the robot runs slower than many other teams the robot does not have any excess wobbling. 
                                </p>
